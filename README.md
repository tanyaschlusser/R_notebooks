# Example Jupyter notebook using Binder and R

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/tanyaschlusser/R_notebooks) Click to launch a live notebook!

This notebook uses [mybinder][mybinder] to serve live notebooks from
a GitHub repository. The Dockerfile shows how to add an IRkernel to
the build, and how to add an external library so that it's available
immediately to users.
